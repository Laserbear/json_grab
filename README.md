# json_grab (Under Construction):

Detect disclosed API data automagically

Based on this talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBi3a-dXsM8

This tool should be able to read page source as you crawl a website and extract all the JSON and detect things formatted like sensitive data.

-incorporate https://github.com/jobertabma/relative-url-extractor (maybe port to Python)

-Fake accounts that talk to each other with PII that you know in advance will make processing very fast
